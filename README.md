# price-csc256-repo

This repository contains my coursework, practice files, and small projects for CSC 256. The goal of this repo is to keep assignments, notes, and example code organized so I can review progress and share work with the instructor or TAs. Each assignment lives in its own folder and includes a short README explaining the solution and how to run any code.

Throughout the semester I will add code examples, lab exercises, and short writeups that document my approach and reasoning. Files are meant to be clear and well-documented so future-me (and readers) can understand solutions quickly. Where appropriate I include small tests or example inputs so results can be verified easily.

This repo is a learning notebook: expect frequent commits, iterative improvements, and documented refactors. If you find anything that can be improved (or broken), please open an issue â€” feedback and collaboration help everyone learn.

# Getting Started
