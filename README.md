This repository contains my coursework and practice files for CSC 256. The goal of this repo is to keep assignments, notes, and small projects organized so I can review them later and show progress over the semester. Each assignment is placed in its own directory with a short README explaining the solution and how to run any code.

Throughout the course I will add code examples, lab work, and short writeups for concepts covered in lectures. The files here are intended to be clear and well-documented so future-me (and the professor/TA) can understand the solution quickly. I will also include small tests where appropriate so it is easy to verify correctness.

This repo is a learning notebook: expect incremental commits, refactors, and explanatory comments. If you find something that can be improved (or broken), please open an issue or send feedback â€” collaboration helps everyone learn.
